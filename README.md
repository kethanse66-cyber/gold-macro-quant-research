Macro-driven quantitative research model for Gold (XAU/USD) integrating USD dynamics, real yields, volatility regimes, and risk-first execution with realistic backtesting and failure analysis.

# Macro-Quantitative Gold Trading Model (XAU/USD)

## Project Objective
This project builds a professional, macro-driven quantitative research model for Gold (XAU/USD).  
The model integrates key macroeconomic drivers—US Dollar strength (DXY), real interest rates, and market volatility—into a systematic, risk-first trading framework.

The focus is on **robust research design**, **regime awareness**, and **real-world constraints** (transaction costs, event risk, drawdowns), rather than on headline profitability.

## Why Gold?
Gold is modeled as a hybrid asset that acts simultaneously as:
- a safe-haven during risk-off regimes
- a hedge against currency weakness
- a macroeconomic signal sensitive to real interest rates and monetary policy

This makes Gold an ideal candidate for macro-quant research.

## Key Features
- Multi-modal data pipeline (Price + Macro + Volatility)
- Regime-based decision framework
- State-machine driven trade logic
- Risk-first position sizing and drawdown controls
- Transaction cost and slippage modeling
- Walk-forward validation across market regimes
- Failure and stress-period analysis (e.g., 2022 rate-hike cycle)
